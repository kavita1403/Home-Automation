# Home-Automation

## Description:-
This is a Motion and intensity based Room lightning system.

## Required Component:-
* Arduino Uno R3
* PIR sensor
* Power Supply
* 2k resistor
* Photoresistor
* Lightbulb
* Relay SPDT
* Jumper wires

## Functioning:-
Here,PIR sensor detect the motion and photoresistor will act as light intensity system.so, when a motion is detected in the presence of zero light intensity ,the bulb will automatically turn ON and in full light -intensity bulb will remain off even if there is any motion detected.
